# Components

We divide the components into app-specific and generic components.

## App-specific components

Place the app-specific components in the `/apps/[app-name]/src/app` folder at the same level as the page that uses the component.

## Generic components

Components are generic if they are used in multiple apps. Place these components in the UI package at `/packages/ui`.

You can write generic components as *compound components*.

Components divided into little parts that work together to accomplish one task are called compound components. You can read about compound components here:
