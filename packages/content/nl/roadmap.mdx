## Roadmap: Goals, priorities, milestones, and conversations to have 

The data hub consists of two elements: a Dataset Browser and a Research application. In the first quarter of 2023, their basic features and outlines were implemented. Afterward, in the rest of the year, the were and will be further developed in line with the goals of the data hub. These consist of mainly two aspects. First, provide an environment in which datasets can be brought together and examined for provenance research purposes and restitution. Namely, a way to answer the question from countries of origin: what is present in The Netherlands? Second, the research application is a space in which communities and individuals can add information, perspectives, and context to objects and collections of objects. Thus, the data hub aims at the accessibility of colonial collection data in The Netherlands. At the moment, the opacity of collection data is a hindrance for individuals and communities seeking answers to questions about their heritage.

To achieve these goals the datahub team prioritizes several milestones and tasks for this year. Moreover, various other conversations are an essential part of the project but have not been examined enough to provide answers to implement directly into the applications. For 2023, the main focus shall be the implementation of features on the themes of perspectives, collections, data enrichment,  input and communication, and (open) data(sets). Features regarding perspectives are the possibility of adding comments, sources, names descriptions, images, links, sound, and add provenance records to an object or a collection of objects. These additions can be moderated through a voting system in which voters can support information. Furthermore, it will be possible to create these collections of objects with others and be part of the community around them. On the object pages, there will be a possibility to contact the data provider. 

The priority of collection data enrichment and the use of linked data will further advance the goals of the data hub. The latter consists of relating events and locations to objects, which can be used to create more visualizations in the user interface. Additionally, an API will be available to access and use the data of the hub, allowing users to formulate their queries and retrieve the data. The datasets that will be added in the second half of 2023 are the catalogs of Museum Bronbeek and Rijksmuseum, and the NIOD research guide. These datasets will also be examined by the integrated opacity measuring tool. 

Conversations that are still taking place concern to what extent it is possible and essential that absolutely everything from the data provider's databases will be shared with the data hub. What about content that has likely nothing to do with colonial collections? And about the control over the cultural data in the hub: would it be possible to delete data of objects that have been returned to their communities and nations of origin?
